Todo List Javascript

This Project is just for learning purpose.

+ You can add a group of your list and add list for each group.
+ Check and uncheck the lists
+ Add Your Name and group Name


- Still very rough, on refactor
- Remove item not there yet
- change name of the list
- styling will come at the end

! It's all front-end, the data won't be saved anywhere, Refresh means destroy All.
